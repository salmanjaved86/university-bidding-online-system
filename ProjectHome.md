This is the open source version of an online bidding system for classes in a university built using Struts2 (JSP). The data storage is implemented using both, MySQL and Google App Engine. Project is for reference (as there is very little code reference for GAE + Struts2 + AJAX on the web) and freely building upon this code for your own purposes.

The code is not very well documented and it may take you time to understand how things work. Also, there is not much explanation I can provide to you here to get you started - just please note that there is a lot of hard work gone in developing this, and it would be a great starting point for you.
